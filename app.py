    ### Objective
    The **Football Vision Analyzer** is an AI-powered tool that analyzes football match footage using computer vision and deep learning. It extracts insights like:
    - Player movements and positions
    - Team control zones
    - Speed and distances
    - Ball possession percentage
                
    ###  Technologies Used
    - **YOLOv8** for player and ball detection
    - **OpenCV** and **ffmpeg**
    - **Optical Flow** to measure the camera movement
    - **K-Means clustering** for team color detection
    - **Streamlit** for the interactive dashboard

    ### Future Features
    - Detailed statistics (heat-maps, passing network)
    - Real-time commentary insights
    - Performance ratings

    ###  Developer
    Built with ❤️ by Harish — a computer science student with a love for AI and football.
